		Welcome to my world <br>
		Although I'm just happy in the internet world <br>
		But if anyone is going to record me, it's just the dark world of my mind <br>
		This website is simply provided so that there is no problem in opening it <br>
		In this simplicity, there are dormant things that tell us the truths of our thoughts <br>
		I never know the best things! <br>
		Everything in my mind is enough <br>
		Reach his world to think about it and create a new world for him <br>
		In such a situation, the only thing that can help me is myself <br>
		So I am alone and I am happy in this loneliness <br>
		I am this! <br>
		My mind is currently occupied with the darkest things in this world <br>
		It is not a question of what is more confusing <br>
		The question is, what can get me involved? <br>
		As long as my mind approves, I will be with him <br>
		What comes out of my mind is the result of my thoughts <br>
		One of the things I think others have a problem with is expressing feelings and mindsets <br>
		One of the biggest problems I think there is no way to cure it <br>
		For now, this is just an image that tells me everything <br>
		But I guess it may not be enough for you <br>
		If I can make other pages for you <br>
		I see and feel something with a picture, so there is nothing to do overtime <br>
		You can download things on my website that you like or maybe you like <br>
		This is repeated for you to understand one thing <br>
		That I can never turn my feelings into things you see <br>
		In the hope of death <br>
